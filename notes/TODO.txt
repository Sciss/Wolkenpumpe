[OK]    - Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ClassCastException: de.sciss.synth.proc.impl.ScanImpl$Impl cannot be cast to de.sciss.synth.proc.Scan$Link
	      at de.sciss.synth.proc.impl.ScanImpl$Impl$$anonfun$copy$1$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$1.apply(ScanImpl.scala:107)

        - 'in' disappears from filter / collector when removing all inputs
        - fine grained param mode (higher keyboard and mouse resolution)
        - tags and tag-based search?
